The psychoactive programming language! Psilo is an experimental language that grants novel methods of intuitive, scalable programming. Click [here](https://discord.gg/svqHSAqtJA) to join the community server (Discord). 

### üèÅ Goals for the project

Psilo is ultimately meant to be a highly-accessible systems programming language. Check out [our roadmap](md/roadmap.md). Here are some of our simplified goals:
- speedy execution times.
- easy to install, code, and run.
- designed for large, long-term, scalable projects.

### üöÄ How to build

Psilo is written in Rust, so [install Rust](https://rustup.rs) if you haven't already. Clone the `main` branch, and open up a terminal in the folder. Use `cargo run` to build and run the project!

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Things we'd like to implement

An unorganized list of unique features we'd like to have down the road:
- static memory management through life-time inference.
- universe-based type/value instancing.

### üöß Some things to note

Development disclaimer: Psilo specification (the rules of the language) and implementation (the compiler) are both very work-in-progress. Everything is suspectible to changes, and early-adopters should not expect that anything stay the same from commit-to-commit.

Pronounced "sillow" (like "willow" with an 's').

### ‚öíÔ∏è How to contribute

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Psilo; we appreciate and encourage you to contribute. At the moment, there are no formal rules for contribution.

Fork the project, write some stuff, open a pull request, and we'll take a look!

### üîé What code looks like

Have a look at [these examples](./examples) of Psilo programs!
