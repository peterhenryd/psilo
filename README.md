The psychoactive programming language! Psilo is an experimental language that grants novel methods of intuitive, scalable programming.

### 🏁 Goals for the project

Psilo is ultimately meant to be a highly-accessible systems programming language. Check out [our roadmap](./roadmap.md). Here are some of our simplified goals:
- speedy execution times.
- easy to install, code, and run.
- designed for large, long-term, scalable projects.

### 🚀 How to build

Psilo is written in Rust, so [install Rust](https://rustup.rs) if you haven't already. Clone the `main` branch, and open up a terminal in the folder. Use `cargo run` to build and run the project!

### 🧑‍🔬 Things we'd like to implement

An unorganized list of unique features we'd like to have down the road.
- Static memory management through life-time inference.

### 🚧 Some things to note

Development disclaimer: Psilo specification (the rules of the language) and implementation (the compiler) are both very work-in-progress. Everything is suspectible to changes, and early-adopters should not expect that anything stay the same from commit-to-commit.

Psilo currently does not have a logo; the image found in this README (Apple's mushroom emoji) is a temporary signum, but it is in no way a logo, nor do we claim ownership of the image whatsoever.

Pronounced "sillow" (like "willow" with an 's').
